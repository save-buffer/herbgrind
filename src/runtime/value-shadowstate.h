// Here are the data structures we set up to hold shadow values. They
// take three forms:
//
// * Values that are being worked on currently are held in temps by
//   VEX, so we have an array of shadow values to match each temp
//   register, up to a limit set in the .h file.
//
// * Values that persist between blocks (I think this is how it
//   works), are held in a per thread data structure by VEX, so we set
//   up another array for every thread to hold those, also up to a
//   limit set in the .h file.
//
// * Finally, values might be written to memory, and then read out
//   later at some arbitrary point. For these, we'll maintain a hash
//   table that maps addresses to shadow values, so we don't have to
//   maintain a vast array of shadow values for all of memory.
